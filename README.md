## Hi, welcome there 👋

I am a junior studying Computer Science at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yesian Rohn](https://yesianrohn.github.io/). I am currently working on some amazing AI projects, which involve data augmentation using CLIP for computer vision, enhancing humor understanding with pre-trained models in natural language processing, and designing reinforcement learning AI algorithms for a small game.

Besides that, I am also a stand-up comedian, specializing in one-liner jokes. Let me tell you a joke about my name: As you know, Jike Zhang is a famous ping-pong player. Coincidentally, in computer networks, "ping" and "pong" are terms used to describe a mechanism for testing connectivity and response time between devices. So maybe I am also a ping-pong sender in a certain sense.
